# kill-ishizaka

this is a full _Work-In-Progress_ refacto of the previous [Destroy Ishizaka](https://github.com/AnthonyDeplanque/Destroy-ishizaka-vercel) project

I've decided to recode it in typescript with my new knowledges

# How to make it work ?

_Make sure you have nodeJs and npm/yarn on your computer !!_

clone the repo,

in the terminal, type `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependancies,


`./launch.sh --test` will delete previous compilations, compile typescrips and launch server

you can also type `./launch.sh --debug` to try a debug mode !

you can access the game on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080);

Have fun !

# How to make it work ?

_Make sure you have nodeJs and npm/yarn on your computer_

clone the repo,

in the terminal, type `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependancies,

`npm run build` to compile the TypeScript,

`npm run start` to launch the server.

you can access the game on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080);

Have fun !

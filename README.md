# How to make it work ?

Make sure you have nodeJs and npm/yarn on your computer

clone the repo

type `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependancies

`npm run build` to compile the TypeScript

`npm run start` to launch the server

you can access the game on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080);

Have fun !
